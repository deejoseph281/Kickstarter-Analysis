# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This project reviewed Kickstarter data campaigns, focusing on 'Plays' that were successful, failed, or canceled and the associated goals of each 'Plays' campaign. The purpose of the project was to understand whether there was a trend for outcomes that led to successful, failed, or canceled campaigns based on their launch dates and based on their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We were able to understand plays by launch date and whether the launch date by month impacted the campaigns probability of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We performed the analysis by pivoting the information into a readable data table then outputting the data tables into a clear visualization of the outcomes. For example, we made a pivot of the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and then displayed the data in a line chart by the outcome of the play by each month. We then created a table using CountIFS to understand the number of campaigns within each goal range for each outcome type. We then displayed the data set visually by line chart showing the percent of each type of outcome relative to each goal range. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? Campaigns are most likely to success when launched in May and June. Failed campaigns follow the seasonality trend that successful campaigns have, with less drastic peaks and lows from month to month. There seems to be no clear seasonal indicator to canceled campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Campaigns are most successful when their goals are less than $5000, and more likely to fail than succeed when the goal is between $15,000 to $35,000 ot above $45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This project reviewed Kickstarter data campaigns, focusing on 'Plays' that were successful, failed, or canceled and the associated goals of each 'Plays' campaign. The purpose of the project was to understand whether there was a trend for outcomes that led to successful, failed, or canceled campaigns based on their launch dates and based on their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We were able to understand plays by launch date and whether the launch date by month impacted the campaigns probability of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The differentiation between COUNTIF for a single criteria and COUNTIFS for multiple criteria was easily missed. 
I did not know how to add the range as a single criteria like a standard IF function, I was forced to research how to countIF the range as multiple criteria instead of a single criteria. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
Campaigns are most likely to succeeed when launched in May and June. 
Campaigns are least likely to succeed when launched in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
Campaigns are most successful when their goals are less than $1,000
Campaigns are more likely to fail than succeed when the goal is above $45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
